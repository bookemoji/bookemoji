# bookemoji

ðŸ“• Bookemoji is a component library for svelte.
Rethought to suite the needs of a sveltekit application.

**Vision**

- It integrates tightly with _your_ sveltekit app. â€” deploys with your application
- It is a set of unstyled components, yours to own and style freely
- No JSX, no obscure errors, just straight svelte and sveltekit.
- Low Dependencies
- Very little magicâ€”just enough for some sorcerers to wield if astute to learn
