# Organizing Stories

A common requirement of component workshops is the ability to place stories within groups.
Groups can function as folders for organizing related concepts, or breaking out stories into broader architectural patterns.

One detail before we start: all components have a group already. The default group is empty string (`""`).

## Setting a Story's group.

You set the group for a single `.book.svelte` component by using the module context (a `&lt;script&gt;` with `context="module"`)

```svelte
<script lang="ts" context="module">
  import type { BookMeta } from "bookemoji";
  export const metadata = {
    group: "My Custom Group",
  } satisfies BookMeta;
</script>
```

The [example](/example) bookemoji has groups used to separate `Runes Mode` components and `Website` components.
You can view [the source for those components](<https://github.com/bookemoji/bookemoji/blob/main/src/routes/(example)/example/stories/WebsiteHero.book.svelte>) to see for yourself.
