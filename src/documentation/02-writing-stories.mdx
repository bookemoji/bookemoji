# Writing Stories

After you've installed and configured bookemoji you'll need to know how to write a story.

Writing stories is intended to be fairly translatable to stories written in StoryBook.

## What is a Story

<details style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
  <summary>Stories are simply svelte components</summary>
  Stories primarily allow a component to have its props rendered dynamically, and externally controlled.
</details>

For bookemoji, a story must:

- be a file within the configured "stories" directory
- have a `.book.svelte` file extension

...and that's it! And that's also by design.

To elevate a story file though—you want to use the `&lt;Story&gt;` component. Read on.

## Writing your first story

First,

1. Run `npm run dev` if not already
1. Create a new file within your stories directory, e.g. `Example.book.svelte`

<p style="margin-top:1rem;">Then, type or paste the below code sample into the file.</p>

Replace the `MyComponent` reference with a real import of a component.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Story, Controls, defineMeta } from "bookemoji/components/v4";
  import MyComponent from "$lib/path/to/your/components/Component.svelte";
  // if your components aren't in $lib, that's fine too!
</script>

<Story name="Default" of={MyComponent} />
```

<details class="reminder" style="margin: 2rem 0;">
    <summary>You can write stories with either svelte 4 or svelte 5</summary>

Svelte 5 path

```ts
import { ... } from "bookemoji/components";
```

Svelte 4 path

```ts
import { ... } from "bookemoji/components/v4";
```

</details>

If your component requires more setup, you can use the slot of the `Story` to do so. See below as an example.

```svelte
...

<Story name="Default" of={Tab} let:args>
  <Figure>
    <Image {...args} />
  </Figure>
</Story>
```

## Using `args`

`args` allow you to present variants distinctly.
They generally are your props, but you can use them creatively to make better stories.

```svelte
<Story name="Default" of={MyComponent}  />
<Story name="Red Variant" of={MyComponent} args={{ color: "red", }}  />

<Story name="Green Variant" of={MyComponent} args={{ color: "green", }}>
    <div class="wrapper">
        <MyComponent {...args}>
    </div>
</Story>
```

## Using `defineMeta`, `argTypes`, and `Controls`

With the variants rendering, it'd be nice if you can present a component and manipulate it from the UI—a key feature of component workshops.

That's where `argTypes` comes in. To establish `argTypes` we use the `defineMeta` function.
Here is the source of the [example Button](/books/Button) as an example

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Story, Controls } from "$lib/components/v4";
  import Button from "$lib/Button.svelte";
  import { defineMeta } from "book-emoji";

  defineMeta<typeof Button>({
    component: Button,

    argTypes: {
      variant: { type: "select", options: ["primary", "secondary", "tertiary"] },
      size: { type: "select", options: ["small", "medium", "large"] },
      disabled: { type: "boolean" },
      loading: { type: "boolean" },
      classes: { type: "text" },
      type: { type: "select", options: ["button", "submit", "reset"] },
      ariaLabel: { type: "text" },
      text: { type: "text" },
    },
  });
</script>

<Story of={Button} name="Basic" args={{ variant: "primary", size: "medium", text: "Primary Button" }} />

<Controls of={Button} story="Basic" />

<Story of={Button} name="Secondary" args={{ variant: "secondary", size: "medium", text: "Secondary Button" }} />
<Controls of={Button} story="Secondary" />

<Story of={Button} name="Tertiary" args={{ variant: "tertiary", size: "medium", text: "Tertiary Button" }} />

<Controls of={Button} story="Tertiary" />
```

In the sample, the `defineMeta` is what allows `Controls` to know the types of `args` of the components.

`Controls` then is keyed by the `name` / `story` properties.
