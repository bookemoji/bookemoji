# Getting Started

Learn how to get started with Bookemoji.

#### Prerequisites:

- An already-scaffolded SvelteKit application (like via `npx sv create`)

## Installation

The installer will scaffold bookemoji within your existing sveltekit application. 
Follow the instructions from the CLI to get it set up.

```js
npm create bookemoji@latest
```

Out of the box, you can now run bookemoji with `npm run dev`.

1. The `svelte.config.js` configuration
2. The route directory structure
