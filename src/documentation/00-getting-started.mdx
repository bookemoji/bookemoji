Learn how to get started with Bookemoji.

#### Prerequisites:

- An already-scaffolded SvelteKit application (like via `npx sv create`)

## Installation

Follow the instructions from the CLI to get it set up.

```js
npm create bookemoji@latest
```

After using the above CLI tool, you can then tweak the application as you desire.
