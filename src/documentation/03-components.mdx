# Components

## Book

The `<Book>` component is the root of your `bookemoji` application.
It recieves a list of `books`, which is provided to other bookemoji components behind the scenes.

It also has an optional `base` prop, which defaults to `/books`.
It is used for constructing urls.

By default, it should recieve `books` and `base` from the layout loader.

It does not have any UI by default.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import type { LayoutData } from "./$types.js";
  import { Book } from "bookemoji/components";

  export let data: LayoutData;
</script>

<Book base={data.base} books={data.books}>
  <slot />
</Book>
```

## Story

`<Story>` is the component used to indicate a variant within a `{Component}.book.svelte` file.

## Controls

`<Controls>` are used to _control_ a story variant's args via UI.
Each Controls is mapped to a specific variant via the `of` and `story` props.

```svelte
<Story name="Story Name" of={SomeComponent} />
<Controls story="Story Name" of={SomeComponent} />
```

**The `name` / `story` props must match, in addition to the `of` prop.**

## StoryList

`<StoryList>` is a convenience component for listing all of the stories and their variants.

Below, the `<Book>` sample has been modified to display as a sidebar layout [really, this is roughly the source of the examples section of the website](/books)

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import type { LayoutData } from "./$types.js";
  import { Book, StoryList } from "bookemoji/components";

  export let data: LayoutData;
</script>

<Book base="/books" books={data.books}>
  <div class="book-layout">
    <div class="book-sidebar">
      <div class="brand-header">
        <h1 class="brand-title">Your Brand Here</h1>
      </div>

      <StoryList />
    </div>
    <div class="book-canvas">
      <slot />
    </div>
  </div>
</Book>
```
