# Components

## Book

The `<Book>` component is the root of your `bookemoji` application.
It receives a list of `books`, which is provided to other bookemoji components via contexts.

It also has an optional `base` prop, which defaults to `/books`.
It is used for constructing urls.

By default, it should receive `books` and `base` from the layout loader.

It does not have any UI by default.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import type { LayoutData } from "./$types.js";
  import { Book } from "bookemoji/components";

  export let data: LayoutData;
</script>

<Book base={data.base} books={data.books}>
  <slot />
</Book>
```

#### Contexts

The `<Book>` component sets these contexts, which you can utilize for your own needs:

- `bookemoji.stories` - a list of the stories detected by bookemoji
- `bookemoji.base` - the `base` route path set within `svelte.config.js`
- `bookemoji.meta` - A `Map<Component, ComponentMeta>`, holding details about all component's "meta" (as set via `defineMeta`)
- `bookemoji.argTypes` - A A key-key-map store of Component to Variant to the `argType` info, as used primarily by `<Controls>` and defined via `defineMeta`

## Story

`<Story>` is the component used to indicate a variant within a `{Component}.book.svelte` file.

## Controls

`<Controls>` are used to _control_ a story variant's args via UI.
Each Controls is mapped to a specific variant via the `of` and `story` props.

```svelte
<Story name="Story Name" of={SomeComponent} />
<Controls story="Story Name" of={SomeComponent} />
```

**The `name` / `story` props must match, in addition to the `of` prop.**

## StoryList

`<StoryList>` is a convenience component for listing all of the stories and their variants.

Below, the `<Book>` sample has been modified to display as a sidebar layout [really, this is roughly the source of the examples section of the website](/books)

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import type { LayoutData } from "./$types.js";
  import { Book, StoryList } from "bookemoji/components";

  export let data: LayoutData;
</script>

<Book base="/books" books={data.books}>
  <div class="book-layout">
    <div class="book-sidebar">
      <div class="brand-header">
        <h1 class="brand-title">Your Brand Here</h1>
      </div>

      <StoryList />
    </div>
    <div class="book-canvas">
      <slot />
    </div>
  </div>
</Book>
```

## StoryCode

The `<StoryCode>` component automatically generates the code representation of a story variant based on the selected props. It's designed to quickly allow developers to grab-and-go a component after tweaking it's props.

### Key Features

**Auto-generated Code**: It takes a component and story name, then automatically generates the corresponding Svelte component code based on the current args/props.

**Syntax Highlighting**: Uses Shiki for beautiful syntax highlighting with customizable themes (defaults to "catppuccin-frappe").

**Collapsible Interface**: Starts collapsed by default to avoid layout shift, with a toggle button (`</>`) to show/hide the code.

**Copy Functionality**: Includes a copy button to easily copy the generated code to clipboard.

### Usage

```svelte
<Story name="Primary Button" of={Button} />
<StoryCode story="Primary Button" of={Button} />
```

### Props

- `of`: The component this code represents
- `story`: The story name (must match the corresponding `<Story>` name)
- `collapsed`: Whether to start collapsed (default: `true`)
- `shikiOptions`: Syntax highlighting configuration
- `tab`: Indentation style (`"  "` or `"\t"`)

The component intelligently handles different prop types - strings get quotes, other values get curly braces, and undefined/empty values are omitted entirely.
