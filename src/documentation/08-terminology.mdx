### Component Workshop

A component workshop serves multiple purposes:

- It enables developers to build, test, and refine components efficiently.
- It allows designers to compare implemented components with design specifications.

Component workshops are helpful because they let everyone—developers, designers, and product teams—try out components and talk about them using the same language.
