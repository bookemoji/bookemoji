<h1>Welcome to Your Customizable Component Library</h1>

<p>
  This page demonstrates the <strong>default bookemoji component workshop</strong>—showing how plain the initial install is. It currently uses the website's

  To preview the type of enhancements you can easily make to bookemoji, <em>enable "Show Customization"</em>.

<h2>Your Opportunity to Customize</h2>
<p>
  The current simplicity of this example is by design—it's a blank canvas. Think of it as a <em>white-label tool</em>, ready to be shaped specifically for you
  and your team.
