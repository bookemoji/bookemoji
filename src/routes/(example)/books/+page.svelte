<h1>Welcome to Your Customizable Component Library</h1>

<p>
  This page demonstrates the <strong>default "bookemoji" component workshop</strong>—showing how plain the initial install is. It currently uses the website's
  default styling and has limited functionality.
  <span style="color: var(--stone-6);">It's also not optimized for mobile devices—Sorry!.</span>
</p>

<p>
  To see a preview of what's possible, <em>enable "Show Customization"</em>.
  <label style="color: var(--link);" for="enable-customizations">Show Customization</label>

<h2>Your Opportunity to Customize</h2>
<p>
  The current simplicity of this example is by design—it's a blank canvas waiting for your brand's visual style! Think of it as a <em>white-label tool</em>,
  ready to be shaped specifically for you and your team.
