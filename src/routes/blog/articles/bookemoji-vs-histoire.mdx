Both histoire and bookemoji are tools for generating story applications—but histoire appears to have lost steam on the svelte support.

### Histoire

> [Histoire](https://histoire.dev/guide/svelte3/getting-started.html) is a tool to generate stories applications (or "books").

<br>

At the time of writing, <a href="https://histoire.dev/guide/svelte3/getting-started.html" target="_blank">Histoire</a> appears to <strong>not</strong> to support svelte 4+.
[Also, it's sveltekit integration may have lost steam](https://github.com/histoire-dev/histoire/tree/main/examples/sveltekit).

**Moment to gush:**

[The Noto Sans Display used by Histoire](https://controls.histoire.dev/story/histoire-controls-src-components-button-hstbutton-story-vue?variantId=histoire-controls-src-components-button-hstbutton-story-vue-0) is just a beautiful font choice for UI. 🧑‍🍳's 💏

### Comparison

Histoire undoubtly is packed full of features. If someone is using vue — it appears to be _the_ choice.
