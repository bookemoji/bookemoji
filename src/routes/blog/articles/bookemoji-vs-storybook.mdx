# {title}

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) is a stable and competent component workshop.
But even with the latest v9.x the storybook experience for svelte and sveltekit is still secondary compared to React.

Professional teams all around the world are using svelte and sveltekit. Those teams are in need of a component workshop that works with and within their existing tools.

Additionally, bookemoji has a key distinction: it is primarily a library that you use within your own sveltekit application—not a separate application.
