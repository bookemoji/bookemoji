[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) is a stable and competent component workshop. I have and will likely continue to _use_ storybook through work on the daily.
But even with the latest v9.x the storybook experience for svelte and sveltekit is still secondary compared to the React experience. _Is it so hard to ask for intellisense in CSF files?_

What I've recently realized is that svelte is no longer a small player.
Professional teams all around the world are using svelte and sveltekit. Those teams are in need of a component workshop that works with and within their existing tools.

A key aspect I wanted when creating bookemoji is that I wanted it to be easily customizable, modular, _yada-yada-all-the-software-engineer-things_.
But I wanted it unobtrusively a library that you use within your own sveltekit application—not a separate application. That's the only way I could see the tooling keep its power.
